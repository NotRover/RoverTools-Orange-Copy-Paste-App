<!--
  Draft the next release's notes in changelog/next.md, with /update-changelog or by
  hand. Start with one or two plain sentences about what the release is for, then fill
  only the sections that apply and delete the empty ones.

  Rules (New / Improved / Fixed ship to users):
  - Substance is the point. One to three sentences per entry: what changed and why it
    helps the user. Not a one-line paraphrase of the commit subject.
  - Give every distinct user-facing change its own entry. Do not collapse a release
    into four lines; bigger releases get fuller notes.
  - Present tense, user perspective. End with a period. Describe the visible effect,
    not the code. No jargon, file names, or internal detail.
  - ASCII punctuation only. No em dashes, curly quotes, or the section sign. Write two
    sentences rather than joining with a dash.
  - feat -> New, perf or a refinement -> Improved, fix -> Fixed.

  Internal work (backend, MCP plumbing, refactors, CI, docs, dependency bumps) goes under
  ### Internal. It is KEPT here for the record but NOT shown to users: the release
  workflow drops the Internal section when it publishes the notes.

  On release the workflow publishes New/Improved/Fixed (minus this comment, the Internal
  section, and any empty section), then moves this file to
  changelog/<version>-<bump>-<channel>.md and opens a fresh next.md. An empty user-facing
  set fails a real release on purpose.

### New

### Improved

- Account sync now runs on its own dedicated address. Existing sign-ins keep working; just update the app.

### Fixed

### Internal

- Move the sync API to `api.orangecp.rovertools.ctx.cl` (app-scoped) in the client and backend, with the status dashboard on `status.rovertools.ctx.cl`. The site and password-reset page stay on the current pages.dev host; `rovertools.ctx.cl` is held for a future site. Clean cutover, no alias.
