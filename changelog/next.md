<!--
  Draft the next release's notes in changelog/next.md, with /update-changelog or by
  hand. Start with one or two plain sentences about what the release is for, then fill
  only the sections that apply and delete the empty ones.

  Rules (New / Improved / Fixed ship to users):
  - One clear sentence per entry: name the visible change and, where it is not obvious,
    the point. Substance comes from being specific, not from being long. Not a bare
    paraphrase of the commit subject, and not a three-sentence paragraph. Add a second
    short sentence only for a real gotcha or before/after; never write three.
  - Give every distinct user-facing change its own entry. Do not collapse a release
    into four lines; bigger releases get more entries, not longer ones.
  - Present tense, user perspective. End with a period. Describe the visible effect,
    not the code. No jargon, file names, or internal detail.
  - ASCII punctuation only. No em dashes, curly quotes, or the section sign. Write two
    sentences rather than joining with a dash.
  - feat -> New, perf or a refinement -> Improved, fix -> Fixed.

  Internal work (backend, MCP plumbing, refactors, CI, docs, dependency bumps) goes under
  ### Internal. It is KEPT here for the record but NOT shown to users: the release
  workflow drops the Internal section when it publishes the notes.

  On release the workflow publishes New/Improved/Fixed (minus this comment, the Internal
  section, and any empty section), then moves this file to
  changelog/<version>-<bump>-<channel>.md and opens a fresh next.md. An empty user-facing
  set fails a real release on purpose.
